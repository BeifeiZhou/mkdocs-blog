# What scientists do and don’t know about the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID vaccine

The road keeps getting bumpier for a vaccine that most researchers say is safe and effective and has huge potential to protect large swathes of the world’s population. Less than a day after the University of Oxford and the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca reported positive early results from the largest trial so far of their COVID-19 vaccine, officials at a US government agency overseeing the trial questioned claims about the vaccine’s efficacy.

“The world, the species, depends on this vaccine. This is 2.5 billion people’s worth of vaccine,” says Eric Topol, a physician-scientist and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California. Lingering questions over the latest trial are “a real mess”, he adds.

The latest development might amount to “nothing more than a technicality”, says Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, UK. But it highlights issues regarding how trial data are being communicated through press releases.
