# Atomic clocks compared with astounding accuracy

The remarkable accuracy of atomic clocks makes them excellent instruments for timekeeping and other precision measurements. Writing in Nature, the Boulder Atomic Clock Optical Network (BACON) Collaboration1 reports extremely accurate comparisons of three world-leading clocks in Boulder, Colorado, housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the JILA research institute. The authors show how their clock comparisons provide insights into fundamental physics and represent substantial progress towards redefining the second in the International System of Units (SI).
